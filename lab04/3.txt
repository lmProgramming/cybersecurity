CrypTool is an open-source project[1] that is a free e-learning software for illustrating cryptographic and cryptanalytic concepts.

History
The development of CrypTool started in 1998. Originally developed by German companies and universities, it is an open-source project since 2001.[2]

Currently 4 versions of CrypTool are maintained and developed: The CrypTool 1 (CT1) software is available in 6 languages (English, German, Polish, Spanish, Serbian, and French). CrypTool 2 (CT2), JCrypTool (JCT), and CrypTool-Online (CTO) are available in English and German.[3]

The goal of the CrypTool project is to make users aware of how cryptography can help against network security threats and to explain the underlying concepts of cryptology.[4]

CrypTool 1 (CT1) is written in C++ and designed for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

In 2007, development began on two additional projects, both based on a pure-plugin architecture, to serve as successors to the original CrypTool program. Both su
